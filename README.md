#### A simple News Reader App ðŸ“± built to demonstrate the use of modern android architectural component with MVVM Architecture

- [Hilt-Dagger] - Standard library for dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Retrofit] -  A type-safe HTTP client for Android.
- [Room] - A library for SQLite object mapping.

- [LiveData] - Data objects that notify views when there is any changes on data.
- [ViewModel] - Holds UI-related data that isn't removed when the UI is changed.
